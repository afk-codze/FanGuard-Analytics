## Introduction
Server-rack fans are critical to datacentre uptime, but mechanical wear gradually introduces excessive vibration and current spikes that precede outright failure. **FanGuard** sits directly on the fan power rail, sampling both vibration (MPU6050, 3-axis) and power draw (INA219). Specifically, this IoT project is developed for **Sapienza University‚Äôs DIAG** structure, focusing on maintaining **high availability** and **fault tolerance** for the laboratory servers.  
A lightweight anomaly-detection model runs in real-time on an **ESP32** under **FreeRTOS**, pushing alerts to the facility‚Äôs MQTT broker and main control dashboard.

## Why we chose RMS?


- **Overall Vibration Level**: RMS provides a single, scalar value that represents the overall energy or intensity of the vibration signal over a given time window. This makes it easy to track changes in the general vibration level of the fan. ¬† 

- **Sensitivity to Changes**: A significant increase in the RMS value often indicates a change in the fan's operational state, which could be cause by anomalies.

- **Correlation with Energy**: RMS is proportional to the energy of the vibration. Increased vibration energy is a key indicator of potential problems in rotating machinery. ¬† 
- **Simplicity and Low Computational Cost**: Calculating RMS is straightforward and computationally inexpensive, reducing the impact on system responsiveness and energy consumption.

## Components & Wiring
The hardware stack is deliberately minimal: a single **ESP32** sits at the centre, sharing an I¬≤C bus with two peripheral sensors‚Äîthe tri-axis accelerometer for vibration analysis and the INA219 for power analytics‚Äîwhile tapping straight into the 5 V fan rail. The diagram below shows the exact pin-to-pin wiring, colour-coded for clarity (power in red, I¬≤C in blue/orange, ground in black).

## General software schema


![Editor _ Mermaid Chart-2025-05-16-113630](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986a5bac-d331-47e3-bba4-a0d677fa5a5b)



## Sampling & Communication Workflow

![Communication task (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3faad33-debe-4a71-bce4-2156f9239219)

The diagram below shows how FanGuard balances high-rate sensor sampling with periodic WiFi/MQTT uploads:

1. **Sampling (30 s)**  
   - **Task 1** runs a tight loop at sampling frequency (Hz):  
     1. Read accelerometer  
     2. Adds values to the window
     3. Enter light-sleep

2. **Parallel Execution (‚âà5 s max)**  
   - **Task 1** calculate RMS, detects anomalies, pushes to communication queue
   - **Task 2** (WiFi/MQTT) kicks off while **Task 1** continues sampling.  
   - To maintain precise sampling frequency (Hz) timing during transmission, **Task 1** uses a delay rather than light-sleep.  
   - **Task 2** publishes buffered data over WiFi/MQTT.  

3. **Resume Normal Sampling**  
   - Once communication completes, **Task 1** returns to its light-sleeped sampling frequency (Hz) sampling loop.

### Why Monitor Server Rack Fans Every 30 Seconds?

This section documents our analysis and reasoning for implementing a 30-second monitoring frequency for server rack fan systems. Our analysis show this is a good balance between detection reliability and system resources.

This system provides early detection of fan anomalies through accelerometer-based vibration monitoring, alerting operators before thermal damage occurs.

#### The Problem: Rapid Temperature Rise

Server racks experience alarmingly quick temperature increases after cooling failure:

- A server rack starting at 20-23¬∞C can reaches critical temperatures in **~5 minutes** after fans failure.

This narrow intervention window requires a carefully calculated monitoring frequency.

####  Response Timeline Components


| Component | Time Required | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Alert processing | 5 seconds | System processing and alert distribution |
| Human response | 120 seconds | Staff receiving alert and beginning intervention |
| Intervention time | 60 seconds | Fix the problem |
| Safety buffer | 25 seconds | Additional buffer for unexpected delays |
| **Total response time** | **210 seconds** | From detection to completed intervention |

With temperatures reaching critical levels 5 minutes, this leaves a maximum allowable detection delay of **90 seconds**.

#### Monitoring Frequency Analysis

We evaluated multiple monitoring intervals:

| Monitoring Frequency | Worst-Case Detection Delay | Safety margin | Viable? |
|--------------------:|---------------------------:|------------------:|:-------:|
|              5 sec  |                    5.0 sec |           85 sec  |   YES   |
|             10 sec  |                   10.0 sec |           80 sec  |   YES   |
|             15 sec  |                   15.0 sec |           75 sec  |   YES   |
|           **30 sec**|                **30.0 sec**|         **60 sec**| **YES** |
|             60 sec  |                   60.0 sec |           30 sec  |   YES   |
|            120 sec  |                  120.0 sec |           none  |    NO   |
|            180 sec  |                  180.0 sec |           none  |    NO   |
|            300 sec  |                  300.0 sec |           none  |    NO   |

#### Why 30 Seconds is Optimal

While intervals up to 60 seconds would technically work, we chose **30 seconds** for these reasons:

- **Safety margin**: Provides additional buffer if response is delayed 
- **Variable loads**: System load fluctuations could accelerate temperature rise
- **Balance**: Strikes optimal balance between detection reliability and system resource utilization

## AI / Machine-Learning Pipeline
This project blends classic condition-monitoring features with a tiny neural-network so that **FanGuard can spot abnormal vibration signatures in real-time‚Äîwithout cloud round-trips**. We collect raw samples from the MPU6050 ant then calculate RMS , label them as *normal* or *anomaly*, and train a compact INT8-quantised Keras model in Edge Impulse. Once flashed, the model executes inside TensorFlow Lite Micro on the ESP32.

### 1. Data acquisition & labelling  
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Sampling source** | ESP32 ‚Üí MPU6050|
| **On-device pre-proc.** | calculation of **RMS** for each sample|
| **Export format** | CSV (`timestamp, rms_x, rms_y, rms_z, label`) |
| **Labels** | `normal`, `anomaly` |
| **Dataset size** | 300 samples ‚Üí 80 % train / 20 % test |

> üìÑ *Code reference*: [src/ml-model/dataset-builder.ino](src/ml-model/dataset-builder.ino)

### 2. Edge Impulse pipeline  
- **Features**: a **Time Series (3)** block consuming the pre-computed `rmse_x`, `rmse_y`, and `rmse_z` inputs.  
- **Learning**: a **Classification** block running our custom Keras classifier (see next section).  
- **Deployment**: export as a **Quantized (INT8)** model using the **EON‚Ñ¢ Compiler**.

### 3. Model architecture & training script  

We extract per‚Äêaxis RMS features from the accelerometer and feed them into a compact, fully‚Äêconnected neural network for anomaly detection. After standard normalization, two hidden layers with regularization and dropout learn to distinguish ‚Äúnormal‚Äù vs. ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù motion patterns. Training uses the Adam optimizer with configurable hyperparameters and early stopping to ensure robust, lightweight inference.

### 4. Model performance & accuracy
The INT8-quantised classifier exhibits high confidence and generalisation on the held-out validation set, making it well-suited for real-time anomaly detection on the ESP32. Below are the core metrics, confusion breakdown, and a 2D feature-space view that together demonstrate both sensitivity to early-warning vibration signatures and robustness against false positives.

## Power consumption: measurements

Below is a snapshot of the device‚Äôs real-time power draw, captured over multiple operation cycles. The chart highlights three distinct phases: **initialization**, **active** WiFi/MQTT/sampling, and **light-sleep** sampling.


![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-15 at 15 41 33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efa06ee1-41e3-44f0-9461-c42c3ed94b26)


## Power Consumption: analysis

This analysis compares two power scenarios for a device over a total duration of 35 seconds:
1.  **Full Active Mode**: A constant power consumption of 400mW for the entire 35 seconds (Sampling time + RMS Calculation + Wifi/MQTT communication ).
2.  **Hybrid Mode**: An initial period of high activity (400mW for 5 seconds), this rappresents Wifi/MQTT communication with5 seconds in the worst case scenario (NUM_MAX_RETRIES * DELAY), followed by a longer period (30 seconds), that rappresents the sampling/rms calculation, utilizing a low-power state (light sleep) with periodic, short bursts of higher power for sampling. **The sampling phase assumes 4ms active time and 1ms light sleep time per cycle (Worst case).**


This comparison helps to illustrate the energy savings we achive on our system. That garantees an life battery time of ~

### Parameters

| Parameter             | Value         |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| **Full Active Power** | 400 mW        |
| **Light Sleep Power** | 25 mW         |
| **Active Burst Power**| 200 mW        |
| **Sampling Frequency**| 200 Hz        |
| **Sampling Cycle** | 5 ms (1/200 Hz) |
| **Assumed Active Time per Sample** | **4 ms** |
| **Assumed Sleep Time per Sample** | **1 ms** (5 ms - 4 ms) |
| **Total Duration Compared** | 35 seconds |


### Calculations

#### **Scenario 1: Full Active Mode (35 seconds)**

In this scenario, the device consumes a constant 400 mW for the entire 35-second duration.

-   **Total Energy**:
    ```
    Energy = Power * Time
    Energy = 400 mW * 35 s = 14000 mJ
    ```


#### **Scenario 2: Hybrid Mode (5s Active + 30s Light Sleep/Sampling - Revised)**

This scenario consists of two distinct phases:

1.  **First 5 seconds (Initial Active Phase)**: The device consumes 400 mW for the first 5 seconds.
    ```
    Energy_initial = 400 mW * 5 s = 2000 mJ
    ```

2.  **Next 30 seconds (Sampling Phase)**: For the remaining 30 seconds, the device cycles between light sleep (25 mW) and brief active bursts (200 mW) for sampling at 200 Hz, with the revised timing (4ms active, 1ms sleep).

    * **Sampling Cycle Details**: At 200 Hz, each sampling cycle takes 5 ms. Within each 5 ms cycle, the device is active for **4 ms** and in light sleep for **1 ms**.

    * **Energy per Sampling Cycle**:
        ```
        Energy_cycle = (Active Time * Active Burst Power) + (Sleep Time * Light Sleep Power)
        Energy_cycle = (4 ms * 200 mW) + (1 ms * 25 mW) = 800 mJ + 25 mJ = 825 mJ per 5ms cycle
        ```

    * **Average Power during Sampling Phase**:
        ```
        Avg Power during Sampling = Energy per Cycle / Cycle Time
        Avg Power during Sampling = 825 mJ / 5 ms = 165 mW
        ```

    * **Energy for 30 seconds of Sampling**:
        ```
        Energy_sampling = Avg Power during Sampling * Time
        Energy_sampling = 165 mW * 30 s = 4950 mJ
        ```

3.  **Total Energy for Scenario 2 (over 35s)**: The total energy is the sum of the energy from the initial active phase and the sampling phase.
    ```
    Total Energy_hybrid = Energy_initial + Energy_sampling
    Total Energy_hybrid = 2000 mJ + 4950 mJ = 6950 mJ
    ```

### Results

| **Scenario** |Avg. Power |
|----------------------------|----------|
| **1. 35s Full Active** | 400 mW     |
| **2. 5s Active + 30s Hybrid** | **198.6 mW**|


### Key Insights

1.  **Energy Savings**: The hybrid approach offers energy savings, even when considering the worst case scenario of ripartition of active mode and light sleep mode. With these parameters (4ms active/1ms sleep), the hybrid mode consumes approximately **50.4% less energy** over 35 seconds compared to staying fully active.

## Security Implications:

### Security Threats

Our system security can be threatened during the WiFi communication between the IoT device and the MQTT broker, here we list possible types of threat:

1. **Tampering**
    
    **Threat**: An attacker could modify the vibration data in transit, potentially causing:   
    
    - **False negatives**: Masking actual anomalies to prevent detection
    - **False positives**: Creating false alarms leading to unnecessary maintenance
    - **System disruption**: Corrupting data to cause processing errors

    **Impact**: Compromised data integrity leading to incorrect anomaly detection and potentially costly maintenance decisions.

2. **Spoofing**

    **Threat**: An attacker could impersonate legitimate IoT devices by:
   
   - Creating fake devices that send fabricated data
   - Hijacking device identities to inject malicious data
   
    **Impact**: data pollution.

4. **Replay Attacks**

    **Threat**: An attacker could capture valid data transmissions and replay them later:    
        
    - Resending old "normal" vibration data to hide developing anomalies
    - Replaying the same data repeatedly to mask actual readings
    - Flooding the system with replayed messages causing denial of service
   
    **Impact**: Outdated or irrelevant data being processed as current, leading to missed anomalies and ineffective monitoring.

### First Implementation: HMAC

In the first version of our system we choose to implement Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) in order to ensure message integrity and authentication. This method is used at the MQTT level where each message has this format: 

    
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | RMS_X | RMS_Y | RMS_Z | SESSION_ID | SQUENCE_NUM | TIME_STAMP | HMAC |
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    
    
The HMAC is computed using:

    
    HMAC = Hash(SecretKey, Payload + Timestamp + SequenceNumber + SessionID)
    
**Key Components**:

- **Hashing function**: SHA256

- **Secret Key**: Shared between server and esp32
    
- **Timestamp**: Used to prevents replay attacks with old captured data

- **Sequence Number**: Monotonically increasing counter for each message from a device,

- **Session ID**: Unique identifier generated when the device is programmed and increase whenever the device restarts. A session terminate when an operator restart the device subsequently an anomaly.

#### Why Not TLS/SSL?

- **HMAC** is significantly lighter:
    - TLS handshakes are computationally expensive, requiring asymmetric cryptography
    - TLS sessions maintain encrypted tunnels for all communications
    - HMAC only adds a single hash calculation per message

- HMAC works with **standard MQTT**: No need to change broker configuration, Works with brokers that **don't support TLS**

- Mixed-Device Environments: Some devices may not support TLS or have outdated TLS implementations, whereas HMAC can provide consistent security across **heterogeneous** device populations

- **Lower Network Overhead** HMAC reduces bandwidth requirements: TLS adds significant overhead to each packet

### Second Implementation: TLS/SSL

After our preliminary assessment about using HMAC over a TLS connection to secure our system communication we performed tests to evaluate with solid data the actual performances of the two different approaches and then use this information to drive our choice into securing the connection.
Performances though cannot be the only factor to take into consideration when choosing a security mechanism, other important factors are:

* Security guarantees
* Complexity
* Interoperatibility

In this paragraph we will briefly compare the two security mechanisms and then contextualize them into our system, also taking into account how our system has evolved from its previous version . 

### TLS vs HMAC

In the first version of our system we needed to send continously every 30 seconds data packets to the mqtt broker, then the cloud application consumed the messages from the broker and validated the messages's HMAC locally using the shared symmetric key with the esp32 board. The system design required lightweight secured messages to prevent attacks happening during the WIFi communication of 
data packets from the board to the nearest access point, the solution we used did not ensure the confidentiality of the data but only its integrity and authenticity; this trade-off was considered acceptable as the transmitted data did not contain sensible or valuable information for anyone other than a human operator tasked with the maintenance of the system. \
What we thought HMAC introduced was a lightweight security solution that added computational stress and configuration management onto the cloud application.

After a review of the system work we transitioned to a different approach by sending to the cloud only relevant information about the detected anomalies, this change in the system behaviour brought many improvements, one of these is reducing the frequency of trasnmissions to the broker, by sending less packets less frequently we could switch the system security to a TLSv1.2 connection, a mechanism we found simpler to implement, that increased the security guarantees of the system by providing confidentiality,integrity and authenticity of the messages. 

After this evaluation we perfomed tests to analyze the real performances of the two approaches and what we found was quite unexpected. 

![alt text](src/tls-connection/graph_scripts/average_hmac_vs_tls_comparison.png)

In the picture above we can see the results of our tests, by considering only the performance aspect, TLS revealed to be faster than HMAC and this is likely due to the fact that the computation step of the hmac for each message slws down the communication step, also we would like to point out that in these results we do not take into consideration that the hmac must be verified at the receiving end, i.e. the cloud application thus adding complexity a computational overhead in another point of the system.

## Cloud Application

The last component of our system is the cloud, here we host an application used to display the anomalies detected by the IoT devices, the anomalies are displayed both in real time and also through the log.

![alt text](src/cloud-application/cloud-app.png)

### The Architecture

In this section we give an overview of the structure and the technologies used for building the application running on the cloud, the application is called "Monitoring System". 

* __MQTT broker__: This is the junction point between the esp32 and the cloud, it lets transfer data from the IoT device to the cloud application.
* __Java__: The programming language used to build the web application running on the cloud, this object-oriented language is largely used to build web applications thanks to the huge amount of support and libraries it offers.
* __Java Spring__: Web development framework that supports many integrated modules that speed up the process of web development by integrating many aspects like: Dabates handling, front-end templating, MVC code structure etc.
* __PostgresSQL__ : Database Management System used to store the data coming from the esp32 and provide historical view of all the data.
* __Html - javascript__: Languages used to build the presentation level look and functionalities.

### Presentation Level

The application is composed of two pages: realtime and Log. In the first page a use can select the interested device to monitor and in realtime the application will show the anomalies detected.\
The log page gives the user a way to access information about anomalies detected in a specific time period.

### Under the hood: the back end

The back end of the application as stated in the previous paragraph uses Java Spring as development framework, so the code is structured following the MVC pattern:

  * __Model__: ORM Model connected to the db models the information coming from the IoT devices: Anomaly, Power and RMS.
  * __View__: From a api call to the proper url it returns the html and javascript code to render the web page.
  * __Controller__: Manages interaction between Model and View, there is a controller that manages API calls from javscript code to retrieve information from the DB and a controller that manages the web pages routing.

At startup the application connects to the MQTT broker and subscribes to the interested topics, when a new message written in json format comes from the IoT devices into the broker, the application consumes it from it, this message is then parsed into a DTO (Data Transfer Object) using a JSON serializer and then stored in the database. \
