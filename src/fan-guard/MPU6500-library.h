 * @brief Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for motion detection.
 *
 * This function is called automatically when the MPU6500's interrupt pin (INT_PIN)
 * goes HIGH, indicating that a motion anomaly has been detected by the sensor.
 * It sets the `motion_anomaly` flag to true.
 *
 * @note IRAM_ATTR is used to place the function in IRAM, which is necessary for ISRs
 * on ESP32 to ensure quick and reliable execution.

 * @brief Enables the Wake-on-Motion interrupt on the MPU6500.
 *
 * Configures the MPU6500 to generate an interrupt when motion exceeding
 * the specified threshold is detected. It also attaches the `motion_isr`
 * to the `INT_PIN`.
 *
 * @param threshold The motion detection threshold in MPU6500 units (4mg per unit).
 * Motion above this threshold will trigger an interrupt.

 * If successful, it configures various accelerometer settings, including
 * enabling the Digital Low Pass Filter (DLPF), setting the acceleration
 * range, and configuring the interrupt pin behavior for wake-up.
 * It also sets up ESP32's external wake-up source.

/**
 * @brief Builds the baseline acceleration profile for the MPU6500.
 *
 * This function performs a two-phase process to establish a baseline for motion detection:
 * Phase 1: Calculates the average baseline acceleration (including gravity component)
 * by taking `BASELINE_SAMPLES` readings.
 * Phase 2: Measures the maximum deviation from the calculated baseline during a
 * second set of `BASELINE_SAMPLES` readings.
 *
 * Based on the maximum observed deviation and `THRESHOLD_MULTIPLIER`, it calculates
 * an appropriate motion detection threshold and then calls `enable_motion_interrupt()`
 * to activate the motion interrupt with this threshold.
 * Serial output is provided to show the progress and results of the calibration.
